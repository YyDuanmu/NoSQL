Look at this indexStats below:
db.orders.aggregate( [ { $indexStats: { } } ] )
[
{
name: 'productName_1_status_1',
key: { productName: 1, status: 1 },
accesses: { ops: Long("4"), since: ISODate("2022-02-16T17:57:53.039Z") },
host: 'cluster0-shard-00-02.cmtcy.mongodb.net:27017'
},
{
name: '_id_',
key: { _id: 1 },
accesses: { ops: Long("1"), since: ISODate("2022-02-16T17:57:53.039Z") },
host: 'cluster0-shard-00-02.cmtcy.mongodb.net:27017'
}
]

1.	What is the name of the collection in which indexStats is being run

The name of the collection in which indexStats is being run is orders.

2.	How many indexes does it have? What are the columns on which the indexes are created (answer per index basis)?

This collection has 2 indexes. '_id_' is created based on '_id' which may be the default index and another index 'productName_1_status_1' is created based on the combination of 'productName' and 'status'.

3.	Have the indexes ever been used? If so, how many times?

Yes. the 'ops' in the accesses statement means the number of operations that used the index. Therefore, '_id_' has been used once and 'productName_1_status_1' has been used 4 times.
